texture---------If you were to define skin texture on a scale of 1-100, a score of 1 would represent extremely rough, bumpy, and visibly uneven skin with large pores and visible flakiness, 
while a score of 100 would represent perfectly smooth, even, and soft skin with minimal visible pores; with increasing numbers indicating progressively smoother skin texture.
